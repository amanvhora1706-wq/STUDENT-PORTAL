🎓 Student Management System – Secure Web Application

Developed a full-stack web application to streamline academic and administrative workflows for educational institutions. The system provides a secure, role-based platform for managing student profiles, course registrations, and academic documents, with a strong focus on usability, security, and scalability.

Built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX, the application supports 500+ students and features encrypted password storage, session-based authentication, email-driven password recovery, and dynamic content updates for a smooth user experience.

I led the complete development lifecycle—from system architecture and database design to backend implementation, AJAX integration, and security testing. The project was completed as part of an academic–industry initiative and won 1st Place in the ADIT Coding Club Competition, selected from 28 teams.
