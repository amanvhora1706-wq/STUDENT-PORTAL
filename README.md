The web-based application, known as the Student Portal, was designed to allow students to create, manage, and update their profiles through a secure and user-friendly interface. Students can register with the application using a unique username and password; students can provide their personal and academic information, upload required documents, recover forgotten passwords, and update their profile information when needed using the Student Portal interface.

Through seamless connections made between the frontend registration forms and the backend database, Student Portal allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of the student data. Integrating client-side interfaces with server-side processes illustrates the practical application of full-stack web development concepts.

The main goals of the Student Portal include building secure authentication, maintaining student registration records within a database, enabling students to upload documents and track them, allowing students to modify their profile, and implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through server-side technologies. Additionally, the project aims to provide a simple, responsive, and intuitive user interface.

Student Portal is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop the frontend of the system, and PHP to handle the backend of the system. To protect user data, student portal has implemented a variety of security measures that include password hashing and server-side validation.

Therefore, while the Student Portal's purpose is to provide a learning environment for developing essential principles of web development, the significance of the project does not extend to the enterprise level at this time.
