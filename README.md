Student Management System – Web Application

Developed a full-stack student management system to simplify academic and administrative tasks for educational institutions. The application allows students to securely log in, manage their profiles, register for courses, and upload documents through a single, user-friendly platform.

Built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the system supports over 500 students and uses encrypted password storage, session-based authentication, and email-based password recovery to ensure data security. AJAX was used to create a smooth, dynamic user experience without unnecessary page reloads.

This project was completed as part of an academic-industry initiative and won 1st place in the ADIT Coding Club Competition, selected from 28 competing teams.
